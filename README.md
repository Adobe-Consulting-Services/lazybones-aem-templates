Adobe Consulting AEM Lazybones Templates
------------------------------------

This project contains project templates (right now just one) for creating Adobe
Experience Manager projects using the [Lazybones](https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones) project creator. Lazybones is a far more interactive project creation
tool than Maven Archetypes. Using these templates allows you to both bootstrap your
AEM project with an appropriate structure, but also enable some of the core features
from [ACS AEM Commons](http://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/).
